/**
*
*Evolutionary Programming
*
*The application aiming to solve a simple task by mimicking the mechanism of the natural evolution.
*Instead of finding something unknown, the user can explicitly specify evolutionary drives.
*Thus the program works as a simple but dynamic environment, with multiple fitness alteration.
*
*Unit.java - contains the representation of a single unit.
*Population.java - contains the representation of units as a group, it depends on the environment.
*Environment.java - contains the evolution(or task) specific details and evolutionary strategies.
*EvolutionEngine.java - contains the core mechanism of the application, the evolutionary algorithm.
